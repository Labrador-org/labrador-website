#### Please keep in mind the following guidelines for any content you might want to upload:

* Annotate your paper to clarify anything you’ve wanted to. Reference each part like this.  
* Answer in one place all the questions you get for your paper - maybe even advice for replicating the experiments - so people will bother you less.  
* Provide anything you couldn’t include in the paper, including supplementary information and experiments.  
* Ramble about your idea, your journey, the concepts behind the project, or just thoughts, because the research paper wouldn’t let you ramble.
